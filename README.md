# Project Name
Build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## Problem Statement

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has a daily dataset on the rental bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. It wishes to use this data to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.

## Conclusions

Bike booking were happening in 'fall' season followed by 'summer' & 'winter'. This indicates, season is a good predictor for the dependent variable.
Maximum Bike booking happened over the months from May to September with a peak in June. This indicates, mnth has some trend for bookings and can be a good predictor for the dependent variable.
Over 45% of the bike booking were happening during Clear weather followed by . This was followed by Mist weather with more than 37%. This indicates, weathersit does show some trendtowards the bike bookings and is a good predictor for the dependent variable.
Saturday and Sunday most of the people avail bike rental service.

Final Model Evaluation Result:

-Train R square :83.7%

-Train Adjusted R square :83.3%

-Test R square :80.6%

-Test Adjusted R square :79.4%
